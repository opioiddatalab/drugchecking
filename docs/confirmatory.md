# Reasons why you might want to consider confirmatrory/secondary testing

<br>
If you have an FTIR machine and are interested in "secondary" testing with GCMS, here is a range of circumstances where lab-based analysis might be helpful. 
<br>

- Fentanyl positive on test strip, but negative on FTIR (low concentration or contamination)
- No detectable opioid matches on heroin samples
- Low FTIR match scores for active ingredient
- Drug mixtures that have 4+ substances
- The first time you see a new drug (e.g., like a PCP analogue)
- If you're interested in synthesis methods (e.g., P2P methamphetamine)
- Subset validation for research publication
- Liquid drugs (can be handled on FTIR, but can be finicky)
- Most pills
- Benzodiazepines
- Organic substances (cannabis leaf, mushrooms)
- Random 10% to 20% of samples for quality assurance
